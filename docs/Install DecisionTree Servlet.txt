1. Note that the java classes need to be compiled using a java version that is compatible with the version used to run Tomcat
2. The first time, it is necessary to create the servlet web application by creating a directory under the Tomcat webapps directory:
   cd {tomcat}/webapps
   mkdir -p decisiontree/WEB-INF/classes/com/bkw/dt
3. Copy the compiled java programs (*.class files)  into their corresponding directories under the created decisiontree/WEB-INF/classes directory:
   cp {github}/decisiontree/target/*.class {tomcat}/decisiontree/WEB-INF/classes
   cp {github}/decisiontree/target/com/bkw/dt/*.class {tomcat}/decisiontree/WEB-INF/classes/com/bkw/dt
4. Copy the web.xml file that has the servlet configuration required for Tomcat:
   cp {github}/web/web.xml {tomcat}/decisontree/WEB-INF
5. Start Tomcat
